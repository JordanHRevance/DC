# DC
Repo for data contracts

## Data Contracts

The Data Contracts are stored in the base folder. There is one for Each Domain.

## Automation

The automation folder stores different Python programs with the purpose of automating the data contracts. 
It has its own README file to explain how to use those automation files.

## Templates

There are templates for the Data Contracts in the Templates folder. They are now out of date, and the automation process will actually create a more updated template. The templates are just around to show where this all came from I guess...
