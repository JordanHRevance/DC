Repo for data contracts

## Data Contracts

The Data Contracts are stored in the base folder. There is one for Each Domain.

## Automation

The automation folder stores different Python programs with the purpose of automating the data contracts. 
It has its own README file to explain how to use those automation files.

## Templates

There are templates for the Data Contracts in the Templates folder. They are now out of date, and the automation process will actually create a more updated template. The templates are just around to show where this all came from I guess...

## Interactive Format

The Interactive Format folder is just around to show a little example of these data contracts created in a more readable way. Might go back and implement this style after finishing all four of the data contracts. You can probably just ignore that for now, unless you really don't want to.
